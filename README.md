# ImageJ-Macro
Macro for using a trained Trainable Weka segmentation model on a folder full of Images

This Macro is used for applying an trained classifier on a batch of Images. 
As the Macro of ImageJ for WEKA was not working I created a new one that works in my case. I had to resize the Images or else ImageJ would crash, however the problem here is my pc with not much computional power.
